  <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>

  <p>The following Terms & Conditions apply to all applications published on the Google Play Store by LoftRoom Games.</p>

  <p>By downloading or using our applications, these terms will automatically apply to you – so please read them carefully before use. You are not allowed to copy, modify, attempt to extract the source code, translate into other languages, or create derivative versions of our apps. All trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and intellectual property rights remain the property of LoftRoom Games.</p>

  <p>LoftRoom Games is committed to ensuring that the apps are as useful and efficient as possible. We reserve the right to make changes to the apps or charge for their services at any time. We will never charge you without clearly explaining what you’re paying for.</p>

  <p>Our apps may store and process personal data you provide in order to deliver our service. It is your responsibility to keep your device and app access secure. We recommend you do not jailbreak or root your device, as this may compromise security and functionality.</p>

  <p>Our applications may use third-party services that declare their own Terms and Conditions. Links to the Terms and Conditions of these services are below:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/terms" target="_blank">Google Play Services</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/admob/terms" target="_blank">AdMob</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/terms/analytics" target="_blank">Google Analytics for Firebase</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://godotengine.org/license" target="_blank">Godot</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>There are certain cases where LoftRoom Games cannot accept responsibility. Some functions of the app require an internet connection. Whether on Wi-Fi or mobile data, we cannot be held responsible if the app does not work fully due to a lack of connectivity or data allowance.</p>

  <p>If you use the app outside a Wi-Fi zone, please note that your mobile network provider's agreement still applies. You may be charged for data usage or other fees, including roaming. Using the app implies your acceptance of responsibility for these costs.</p>

  <p>Likewise, we are not responsible for how you use the app—for example, if your device runs out of battery and cannot access the Service.</p>

  <p>We aim to ensure the app is up to date and functional. However, we rely on third parties for certain data, and we cannot accept liability for losses resulting from relying solely on app-provided information.</p>

  <p>The app is currently available for Android. System requirements may change, and updates may be necessary to continue using the app. LoftRoom Games does not guarantee the app will always be compatible with your device or Android version. You agree to accept updates when offered. We may also choose to discontinue the app at any time without notice.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</h2>

  <p>We may update our Terms and Conditions periodically. Please review this page regularly for any changes. Updates will be posted here.</p>

  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 2021-10-20</p>
